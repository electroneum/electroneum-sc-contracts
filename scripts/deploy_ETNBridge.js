/*
 * deploy_ETNBridge.js
 *
 * This script deploys the ETNBridge.sol along with its ERC1967Proxy contract and sends the Bridge Owner balance to ETNBridge contract
 * 
 * Breakdown:
 * 1) Check if ETNBridge is already deployed at "0xe5da12b1bcf74ff0aec20671beabc466f8b54727" and if not, then:
 * 2) Get current balance of the bridge contract owner (this should be the legacy chain circulating supply)
 * 3) Deploy ETNBridge and ERC1967Proxy
 * 4) Get current balance of the bridge contract owner again (after deployment)
 * 5) Calculate the deployment cost by subtracting balance #4 from #2
 * 6) Estimate gas cost & fees based on current network conditions
 * 7) Reimburse the deployment costs + extra for subsequent fee from one of the validators to ETNBridge contract owner. This assures the ETNBridge contract ends up with the correct balance (#2)
 * 8) Send the circulating supply balance (#2) from ETNBridge account owner to the ETNBridge contract
